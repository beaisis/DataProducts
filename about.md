This application is based on "California Investor Owned Utility (IOU) Interconnection Net Energy
Metering (NEM) Solar PV Data" (https://www.californiasolarstatistics.ca.gov/data_downloads/)

The data is summarized by county and sector and the user can choose a county and sector of interest.  The amount of solar Megawatts delivered by the projects for a county and sector, the number of projects, the average length from approval to completed and top solar installers are provided.

The initial load of the data may take 10-20 seconds depending on the user's environment. Once loaded, the user may select Sector and County of interest.

The application is written in R using Shiny for the interactive user interface.

Complete documentation of the code can be found here:
