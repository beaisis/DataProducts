# California Solar Installs : Coursera Developing Data Products Course Project


The California Solar Statistics https://www.californiasolarstatistics.ca.gov), is a California state agency that provides to the general public data summaries on a variety of solar initiatives. 

This study looked at the interconnected solar installation data set, availble here (https://www.californiasolarstatistics.ca.gov/data_downloads/) that contains all interconnected (excluding pending and decommissioned) roof top projects, with a single row for each interconnection.  

The user can select a California county of interest and observe, for that county, the number of solar projects in a Quarter, the amount MegaWatts delivered by those projects, the average time of delivery of a solar project and the installers responsible for the projects.

The user can specify industrial or commerical or both as a filter.
